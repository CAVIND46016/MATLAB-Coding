# NRZ line coding:
In telecommunication, a non-return-to-zero (NRZ) line code is a binary code in which 1s are represented 
by one significant condition (usually a positive voltage) and 0s are represented by some other significant 
condition (usually a negative voltage), with no other neutral or rest condition.
